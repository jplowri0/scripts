# scripts
For CYB6004, I have use the Scripts folder as my Git repository. This means that I have errorneously gitted one directory 
too high in the directory hierarchy. This is resulted with one combine git for both my portfolio (assessment 3) and my 
assigniment (assessment 4). 

Therefore you will see commits for both the assessment 4 and assessment 3 in the one git history. 

To avoid confusion for submission, for assessment 3, I have downloaded this repository, removed the assignment directory 
(assessment4) and zipped it. 

For assessment 4 submission, I have downloaded this repository again, removed the portfolio directory and zipped it. 

For assessment 4, to execute the program, navigate to scripts/assignment and execute the ./start.sh script. This will 
launch the program.
