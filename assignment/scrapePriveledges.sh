#Below uses a for loop to scrape mulitple of pages. This is due to that there are only 50 records per page. So we must cycle through each 
#page in order to get all the data. I set a range for page 1 to page 6 as there are only 6 pages. 
#The files are renamed to watchOSdos.html for clarity and are saved in the scrapedData directory.
