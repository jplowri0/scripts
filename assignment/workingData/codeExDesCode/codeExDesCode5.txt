ImageIO in Apple iOS before 9.1, OS X before 10.11.1, and watchOS before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via crafted metadata in an image, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5936, CVE-2015-5937, and CVE-2015-5939.
FontParser in Apple iOS before 9.1, OS X before 10.11.1, and watchOS before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted font file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5942.
The CoreGraphics component in Apple iOS before 9.1, OS X before 10.11.1, and watchOS before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5925.
The CoreGraphics component in Apple iOS before 9.1, OS X before 10.11.1, and watchOS before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5926.
dyld in Dev Tools in Apple iOS before 9 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted app.
CoreText in Apple iOS before 9 and iTunes before 12.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted font file.
IOHIDFamily in Apple iOS before 9 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted app.
IOKit in the kernel in Apple iOS before 9 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted app, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5844 and CVE-2015-5845.
IOKit in the kernel in Apple iOS before 9 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted app, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5844 and CVE-2015-5846.
IOKit in the kernel in Apple iOS before 9 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted app, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5845 and CVE-2015-5846.
Data Detectors Engine in Apple iOS before 9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted text file.
The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 uses an integer data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.
The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 does not properly track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.
